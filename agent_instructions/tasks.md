## Tasks (2026-01-21)

- [x] Remove the hard-coded `"Runtime Terror"` team-name dependency in `FeatureEngineer` so “my team” is driven by `draft_state.my_team_name`.
- [x] Normalize draft creation defaults in the API to avoid duplicating magic team-name strings.
- [x] Add a small unit test covering the `FeatureEngineer` comparative-advantage fix.
- [x] Run the test suite and ensure it passes.
